In my [dsa-implementations] repo, you will find C++ implementations of a selection of some data structures and associated algorithms that are not included by default in the C++ STL, along with some basic unit testing. While I originally wrote them for use in competitive programming (particularly Leetcode competitions). Feel free to repurpose them to your hearts desire. This is the current list of included data structures and algorithms:

- Binary Search
    - Exact match, upper bound, lower bound
- Graphs
    - DFS, BFS
    - Dijstkra's algorithm
    - Bellman-Ford
    - Floyd-Warshall
    - Topological Sorting
    - Kruskals's Algorithm for MST
- Tries
    - Lowercase English Characters only, as well as any valid char
- Union-Find
    - Vectors based Union-Find by Rank implementation
- Flow Networks
    - Edmond's Karp algorithm to find the max flow
- String Searching
    - Rabin-Karp rolling polynomial hashing
    - Knuth-Morris-Pratt
- Segment Trees
- Fenwick Trees (Binary indexed trees)
